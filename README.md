## SensorTag 2561 with Intel Edison over BLE

The [TI SensorTag](http://www.ti.com/tool/cc2541dk-sensor) is a portable low-power module that uses Blueooth Low Energy (BLE, Bluetooth 4.0) and various sensors to communicate data to any BLE reciever. 

Intel Edison has built-in Bluetooth, so no need of external USB Bluetooth dongle.

The python scripts that interface with the Intel Edison were gently modified from _[msaunby's Raspberry Pi Scripts.](https://github.com/msaunby/ble-sensor-pi)_
